# Mountains

This is a small graphic design project I've created that uses the programming language Processing. In it, I auto generate mountains in the style of the video game named Okami using noise and generate the clouds using perlin noise. For their coloring, I use a function called lerpcolor that changes color based on the current position on the screen. I also generate some other objects like a sun or small creatures. Here are some screenshots of possible generations:
